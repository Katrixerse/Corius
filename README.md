Attention: I have started a new bot recently and so this bot wont recieve any major updates anymore and no longer really worked on since i think starting from the ground up again we can improve a lot of things again and fix the issues with this one 

# Corius
Written in discord.js of course 

If you find any bugs please make a issue so i can look into it and fix it

Made By:
- Katrixerse (me)
- Gold Prince

Special Thanks to:
- dragonfire535 - Some api commands & some canvas commands
- reztierk - Help with mysql statements and some coding 

 Will use mySQL instead of sqlite to store data (Better this way for reading/writing data)

Hosting

First, download all the files and put them in a folder.

Need to create a new app at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create and then need to fill out the bots name and select its avatar then create it. Once done that find where is says Bot and click create a bot user and hit yes, do it

Now you want to go back to bot go to token and click token: click to reveal this will show you the bot token now edit config.json in assets where it says, "token": "Your token" with your bot token once done click save.

Now you have done that you will need NodeJs installed can get it from https://nodejs.org/en/ so you can start running the bot.

Now right click the folder in an empty space where you put the files in then click open command prompt.

Need to install all the packages it depends on with npm install.

Follow this guide to setup mysql: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-18-04

(make sure to edit DbConnection to your database info)

When done downloading the dependencies and setting up mysql, run node app.js, to start the bot.

Now invite the bot to your server using an invite like this https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={your_bot_id}&permissions=8&scope=bot

Make sure to replace your_bot_id with your bots id

Once invited the default prefix is c! incase you have dms turned off (bot sends a first time message when invited to guilds)

c!help will give you a command list from there enjoy using the bot

If you want to run this bot while not having the console or terminal open, use nodemon or pm2 (ex. pm2 start app.js)

If wanting to host this bot and keeping it on 24/7 i would recommend digitalocean

Here is a guide for that: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-do-i-set-up-a-discord-bot
